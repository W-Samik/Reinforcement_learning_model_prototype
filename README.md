## 🌟 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares sales data by handling missing values, outliers, and invalid entries.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Generates visualizations to explore relationships between product price, sales, and conversion rates.
- **Custom Gym Environment**: Simulates a market environment where the agent adjusts prices and observes sales outcomes.
- **PPO Model Training**: Uses the `stable-baselines3` library to train an RL agent for price optimization.
- **Visualization Tools**: Plots training results, including price, sales, and reward trends over time.
